New features implemented in March/April 2015
 1. Expose the calculation of estimated error for *refined* UB matrix; 
  * Equation: $$\alpha$$
   
    $$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

  * Next


Features:
 1. UB matrix calculation
  * Calculate UB matrix from 2 reflections;

  * Refine UB matrix by least square fitting
 2. Experiment plan from known UB matrix
  * Calculate motor positions from Miller index (HKL)
 3. Testing:
  * Unit test
